                <h2>MILKY WAY GALAXY</h2>
                <p>The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a vast, spiral-shaped collection of stars, planets, gas, and dust stretching over
                     100,000 light-years in diameter. Within its spiral arms, our solar system resides on one of the outer edges.
                      The Milky Way is teeming with billions of stars, including our Sun, and hosts an array of celestial wonders 
                      such as nebulae, clusters, and pulsars. As we gaze into the night sky, we are witnessing the brilliance of our
                       galactic home.</p>

                    <p>One of the closest neighbors to the Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy, located about 2.5 million light-years away.
                     Andromeda is a majestic spiral galaxy similar in structure to our own, and it's on a collision course with the Milky 
                     Way. Scientists predict that in about 4 billion years, these two galaxies will merge, forming a new, larger galaxy.</p>
                    
                   <p> Beyond Andromeda, there's the Triangulum Galaxy, a smaller spiral galaxy that is part of the Local Group, a collection
                     of galaxies that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda. The Triangulum Galaxy, also known as M33, is characterized by
                      its loosely bound spiral arms and is about 3 million light-years away from us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each galaxy has its unique characteristics and history, contributing to the vast tapestry of the universe. Studying
                     galaxies helps astronomers unravel the mysteries of cosmic evolution, from the birth of stars to the dynamics of
                      galactic collisions. The diversity of galaxies in our cosmic neighborhood provides a fascinating glimpse into the
                       intricacies of the universe beyond our own celestial doorstep.</p>
