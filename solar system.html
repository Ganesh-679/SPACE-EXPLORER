        <h2>Sun</h2>
        <image src="sun-1.jpg"></image>
        <p style color>The Sun, the radiant star at the center of our solar system, is a dazzling celestial body that has captivated human imagination
             for millennia. It is a colossal, seething ball of hot, ionized gas, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, undergoing 
             nuclear fusion in its core. This process releases an immense amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which 
             sustains life on Earth and influences the dynamics of the entire solar system.</p>

           <p> With a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, the Sun's gravitational pull governs the orbits of planets,
             moons, and other celestial bodies within its gravitational grasp. Its surface, or photosphere, appears as a brilliant,
              glowing disk when viewed from Earth. Dark spots, known as sunspots, and intense magnetic activity create a dynamic and 
              ever-changing solar surface.</p>
            
            <p>The Sun's energy production is driven by the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium in its core, where temperatures reach 
                millions of degrees Celsius. This continuous nuclear fusion generates a solar wind—a stream of charged particles that 
                extends throughout the solar system, influencing the behavior of planets and shaping the heliosphere.</p>
            
           <p> While the Sun is essential for sustaining life on Earth, its influence extends beyond providing warmth and light.
             Solar phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections can impact our technological infrastructure, affecting 
             satellites, power grids, and communication systems. Studying the Sun is crucial for understanding the fundamental processes
              that govern not only our local cosmic environment but also the nature of stars across the universe.</p>

    <div id="mercury" class="planet-section">
        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <video  controls src="mercury.mp4"></video>
        <p>Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, is a fascinating and enigmatic world that orbits
             the Sun at an average distance of about 57.9 million kilometers. Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury boasts extreme 
             temperature variations due to its lack of a substantial atmosphere to retain heat. During its daytime, surface temperatures 
             can soar to a scorching 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit), while nighttime temperatures plummet to a frigid -180
              degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

            <p>With a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is marked
                 by vast plains, impact craters, and steep cliffs, providing insight into the planet's geological history. One prominent
                  feature is the Caloris Basin, a colossal impact crater that spans about 1,550 kilometers in diameter.</p>
            
            <p>Mercury's rotation is unique; it takes about 59 Earth days for the planet to complete one rotation on its axis,
                 but its orbital period around the Sun is only about 88 Earth days. This results in a peculiar three-to-two spin-orbit 
                 resonance, meaning that Mercury completes three rotations for every two orbits around the Sun.</p>
            
           <p> Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not visible from Earth as often as some other planets due to its tight orbit.
             Only fleeting glimpses during dawn or dusk make it visible, and space missions like NASA's MESSENGER have provided valuable
              data, enhancing our understanding of this mysterious and dynamic planet.</p>

    <div id="venus" class="planet-section">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <video controls src="venus.mp4"></video>
        <p>Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the Sun and the closest one to Earth. It shares 
            similarities in size and composition with our planet, having a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers. However, its 
            atmosphere and surface conditions are vastly different, making Venus a hostile and inhospitable world.</p>

            <p>Venus is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid. 
                This dense atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and resulting in surface temperatures that can soar
                 to around 465 degrees Celsius (869 degrees Fahrenheit), making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Despite these
                  extreme conditions, Venus exhibits intriguing atmospheric phenomena, including fast winds and a super-rotation where
                   its atmosphere rotates much faster than the planet itself.</p>
            
           <p> The surface of Venus is obscured by a perpetual layer of thick clouds, making direct observations challenging. However,
             radar mapping from spacecraft like NASA's Magellan has revealed a diverse landscape featuring highland regions, vast volcanic 
             plains, and large shield volcanoes. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, stands at about 11 kilometers (7 miles) 
             above the average surface elevation.</p>
            
           <p> Venus rotates slowly on its axis, completing one rotation roughly every 243 Earth days, but its day, defined by one complete
             orbit around the Sun, is only about 225 Earth days. Recent missions, such as the European Space Agency's Venus Express and 
             NASA's Parker Solar Probe, continue to contribute to our understanding of Venus and its complex dynamics, helping scientists
              unravel the mysteries of this fascinating but harsh planetary neighbor.</p>

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <video controls src="earth.mp4"></video>
        <p>Earth, our home in the vastness of the cosmos, is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. With a diverse range
             of ecosystems, it supports a staggering variety of life. Earth's diameter is approximately 12,742 kilometers, and it has 
             a unique and dynamic geology that includes mountains, valleys, oceans, and plains. The planet's atmosphere, a delicate 
             balance of gases, sustains life by providing oxygen, regulating temperature, and protecting against harmful solar radiation.</p>

            <p>Water, a defining feature of Earth, covers about 71% of its surface in the form of oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. This 
                abundant water is essential for the existence of life as we know it. Earth's magnetic field, generated by the movement 
                of molten iron in its core, acts as a protective shield, deflecting solar winds and preventing them from stripping away
                 our atmosphere.</p>
            
           <p> The planet experiences a variety of climates and weather patterns due to its axial tilt, which causes seasonal changes.
             Earth's rotation on its axis gives rise to day and night, with a rotation period of approximately 24 hours. The Earth also
              orbits the Sun, completing one orbit roughly every 365.25 days, defining our concept of a year.</p>
            
           <p> As the only known celestial body with confirmed life, Earth is a precious and fragile oasis in the vastness of space.
             It serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of all living things and the need for responsible stewardship to ensure
              the well-being of our planet for future generations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="mars" class="planet-section">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <video  controls src="mars.mp4"></video>
        <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, has long captured the imagination of scientists and enthusiasts alike. Often called the 
            "Red Planet" due to its rusty appearance, Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers. The planet is 
            characterized by a diverse landscape that includes towering volcanoes, expansive deserts, and a canyon system far grander than
             any on Earth—the Valles Marineris, which stretches over 4,000 kilometers.</p>

           <p> Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system, reaching a height of approximately 21 kilometers.
             The planet's surface also features a variety of channels and valleys, suggesting the past presence of liquid water. Evidence
              from missions like NASA's Mars rovers indicates that Mars once had rivers, lakes, and perhaps even an ocean, fueling
               speculation about the possibility of past life.</p>
            
            <p>Despite its intriguing geological features, Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, making it 
                inhospitable for humans. Surface temperatures can range from a chilly -195 degrees Fahrenheit (-125 degrees Celsius)
                 near the poles to a milder 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) in equatorial regions. Numerous missions, including 
                 the Mars rovers Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance, along with orbiters like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,
                  continue to explore and study the Red Planet, seeking clues about its history and potential for past or present life.
                   The goal of future missions is to pave the way for human exploration and, ultimately, the possibility of establishing
                    a human presence on Mars.</p>

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <video  controls src="jupiter.mp4"></video>
        <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant that commands attention with its immense size and striking
             appearance. Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid 
             surface. With a diameter of about 142,984 kilometers, it is more than 11 times wider than Earth and has a powerful magnetic
              field that is 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.</p>

           <p> One of Jupiter's most iconic features is the Great Red Spot, a colossal storm that has been raging for at least 350 years.
             This massive storm is so large that it could engulf Earth multiple times over. Jupiter also boasts a system of rings, although
              they are much fainter and less complex than Saturn's.</p>
            
            <p>Jupiter has a family of at least 79 known moons, including the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—known as 
                the Galilean moons. These moons are a subject of intense scientific interest due to their unique characteristics, such 
                as the potential subsurface ocean on Europa.</p>

        <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is a unique and enigmatic ice giant that distinguishes itself with its distinct pale
             blue-green hue. It is the third-largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 51,118 kilometers, and
              is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane. Unlike the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has a
               distinct tilt, rotating nearly on its side, likely the result of a long-past collision.</p>

           <p> Uranus is often referred to as an "ice giant" because, beneath its gaseous atmosphere, it harbors a substantial icy and 
            rocky core. Its atmosphere contains clouds of ammonia, methane, and water vapor, which give the planet its characteristic
             color. The upper atmosphere of Uranus is marked by strong winds and a lack of prominent storm features, making it appear
              relatively serene compared to other gas giants.</p>
            
            <p>Uranus has a system of faint rings and a retinue of at least 27 known moons. Its largest moon, Titania, is the eighth-largest
                 moon in the solar system. The Voyager 2 spacecraft provided valuable insights during its flyby in 1986, revealing details 
                 about Uranus's atmosphere, rings, and moons. Despite its distant location and relatively limited exploration, Uranus
