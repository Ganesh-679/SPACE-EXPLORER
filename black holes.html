                <p>A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational
                     pull. This phenomenon occurs when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and undergoes gravitational collapse. 
                     The core contracts under its own gravity, and if the mass is above a certain critical value (approximately 2.5 to
                      3 times the mass of our sun), it collapses into a point of infinite density known as a singularity, surrounded by 
                      an invisible boundary called the event horizon.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Black Holes:</h2>
                   <h3> Stellar Black Holes:</h3>
                    
                   <p> Formed from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.
                    Typically have a mass ranging from about 3 to 10 times that of the sun.
                    Intermediate Black Holes:
                    
                    Hypothetical black holes with masses between 100 and 1000 times that of the sun.
                    The existence of intermediate black holes is still being studied and debated.
                    Supermassive Black Holes:
                    
                    Found at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way.
                    Can have masses equivalent to millions or even billions of times that of the sun.
                    Properties of Black Holes:
                    Singularity:
                    
                    The core of a black hole is a singularity, a point where density becomes infinite and the laws of physics,
                     as we understand them, break down.
                    Event Horizon:
                    
                    The boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing can escape is called the event horizon. Once an object
                     crosses this boundary, it is inevitably drawn into the black hole.
                    No Hair Theorem:
                    
                    This theoretical concept suggests that all black holes are indistinguishable from each other if you ignore their mass, 
                    charge, and angular momentum. In essence, black holes are characterized by just three properties.
                    How We Detect Black Holes:
                    X-ray Emissions:
                    
                    Black holes can be identified by the X-ray emissions generated as surrounding matter is pulled toward the event horizon
                     and heated to extremely high temperatures.
                    Gravitational Waves:
                    
                    The detection of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, has provided
                     a new way to observe black hole mergers.
                    Observing Stellar Orbits:
                    
                    By studying the orbits of nearby stars, astronomers can infer the presence of an invisible and massive
                     object—potentially a black hole—exerting gravitational forces.</p>

                    <h2>Hawking Radiation:</h2>
                    <p>Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes are not completely black but instead emit a faint
                     radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This phenomenon, known as Hawking radiation, suggests that
                      black holes can slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate over immense timescales.
                    
                    In summary, black holes are captivating celestial objects with properties that challenge our understanding of the 
                    fundamental laws of physics. The ongoing research and advancements in observational techniques continue to unveil
                     the secrets of these enigmatic entities, contributing to our broader comprehension of the cosmos.
